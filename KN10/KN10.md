# KN10

I just followed the instructions which were described in the AWS course:

## A) Kostenrechnung IAAS - Rehosting (60%)
### Azure:
![azure_costs_detailed_all](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/276fcc8f-ab64-4b7f-a1d8-21741227c6b9)

### AWS:
![aws_costs_detailed_all](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ac8f57-5c63-4bdf-9259-689446d49a2a)

#### Why did I choose this? (Azure)
In Azure, I chose "Web Service" for the web server because you can build web applications, services, and RESTful APIs with it, so it's basically a fully managed web hosting service. This is, in my opinion, the optimal choice for hosting a web server as described.

As for the database, I've chosen the "Azure Database for PostgreSQL" because - as the name suggests - it's specialized for a database running PostgreSQL, one of the most popular database options out there.

#### Why did I choose this? (AWS)
I chose the "Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL" for the database because this service provided by my Amazon is specialized for databases and also runs PostgreSQL, a very stable relational database management system.

For the web server I chose the "EC2" instance because it is also specialized for running such services and also because we already worked with it in a previous KN, so I know what kind of services it is good for.

## B) Kostenrechnung PAAS - Replattforming (20%)
For the Database I would take the "Standard" Option under Heroku Postgres

The same goes for the Webserver, I chose "Standard" under the "Choose your dynos" option
![heroku_webserver](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750ccd00-7a3d-4e4c-b9be-19c49de00885)

I chose this for the reason that these options deliver the same (or more) performance 

## C) Kostenrechnung SAAS - Repurchasing (10%)

## D) Interpretation der Resultate (10%)
