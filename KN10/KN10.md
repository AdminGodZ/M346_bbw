I just followed the instructions which were described in the AWS course:

### AWS:

#### Why did I choose this? (Azure)
In Azure, I chose "Web Service" for the web server because you can build web applications, services, and RESTful APIs with it, so it's basically a fully managed web hosting service. This is, in my opinion, the optimal choice for hosting a web server as described.

As for the database, I've chosen the "Azure Database for PostgreSQL" because - as the name suggests - it's specialized for a database running PostgreSQL, one of the most popular database options out there.

#### Why did I choose this? (AWS)
I chose the "Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL" for the Database, because this service provided my amazon is specialized for Databses and also runs PostgreSQL, a very stable relational database management system.

For the webserver I chose the "EC2" Instance because this also is specialized for running services like this and also because we already worked with it in an earlier KN, so I know for what kind of services it is good for.

## B) Kostenrechnung PAAS - Replattforming (20%)
For the Database I would take the "Standard" Option under Heroku Postgres

The same goes for the Webserver, I chose "Standard" under the "Choose your dynos" option
