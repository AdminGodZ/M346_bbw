# KN10

I just followed the instructions which were described in the AWS course:

## A) Kostenrechnung IAAS - Rehosting (60%)
### Azure:

### AWS:
![aws_costs_detailed_all](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ac8f57-5c63-4bdf-9259-689446d49a2a)

#### Why did I choose this? (Azure)
In Azure, I chose "Web Service" for the web server because you can build web applications, services, and RESTful APIs with it, so it's basically a fully managed web hosting service. This is, in my opinion, the optimal choice for hosting a web server as described.

As for the database, I've chosen the "Azure Database for PostgreSQL" because - as the name suggests - it's specialized for a database running PostgreSQL, one of the most popular database options out there.

#### Why did I choose this? (AWS)
I chose the "Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL" for the database because this service provided by my Amazon is specialized for databases and also runs PostgreSQL, a very stable relational database management system.

For the web server I chose the "EC2" instance because it is also specialized for running such services and also because we already worked with it in a previous KN, so I know what kind of services it is good for.

## B) Kostenrechnung PAAS - Replattforming (20%)
For the Database I would take the "Standard" Option under Heroku Postgres

And for the Webserver I chose "Standard" under the "Choose your dynos" option

#### Why did I choose this?
I chose this because these options deliver the same (or better) performance as the services require, these were the best options available that were not overpriced and yet good enough to handle running these services.

## C) Kostenrechnung SAAS - Repurchasing (10%)
From these listed below, I chose the one from SalesForce

![zoho](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28011ea2-bed6-4520-bca4-dc28520d7f62)


#### Why did I choose this?
I made this decision because this was the only offer that had all the features that the web server and database needed (specifications).

## D) Interpretation der Resultate (10%)
Azure and AWS are Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms that charge based on usage. Azure's fully managed web service and PostgreSQL database offer a straightforward setup, while AWS offers EC2 for hosting and RDS for databases with more customisation. AWS generally has competitive global pricing, but both platforms can have hidden costs such as data transfer, backups and monitoring.

Heroku, a platform-as-a-service (PaaS), simplifies deployment by managing the infrastructure for you. Its standard tiers for Dynos and PostgreSQL are more expensive upfront than IaaS, but save you time and effort. Additional costs may apply for features such as advanced monitoring or scaling.

Salesforce as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) bundles everything for a fixed price and offers integrated tools for web and database needs. It's the most expensive option, but requires minimal setup, making it ideal for businesses that prioritise ease of use. Zoho is a cheaper SaaS alternative, but less flexible.

The differences in cost reflect the value of each model: IaaS offers flexibility and control, PaaS emphasises simplicity and SaaS delivers fully managed solutions. The choice depends on technical requirements, budget and scalability goals.
