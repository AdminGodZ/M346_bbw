### Setting Up the Virtual Machine and Assessing Host Resources

1) I began by installing the Ubuntu Server ISO and VirtualBox to create a virtual environment for running the ISO.

2) Next, I evaluated the performance capabilities of my host machine, specifically focusing on the available CPU cores and RAM:
   - Performance Cores: 20
   - RAM: 64GB
   - (For the virtual machine, I allocated 4 cores and 8GB of RAM)

### Verifying RAM and CPU Core Allocation via Ubuntu

3) After installing the Ubuntu Server on the virtual machine, I verified the number of CPU cores available using the following command:
   - `lscpu | grep "CPU(s)"`

4) Subsequently, I maximized the number of allocated CPU cores and restarted the virtual machine to reflect this change:

5) I then repeated the process for RAM allocation:
    - `free -g"`
   - RAM before adjustment:

It is important to note that although my host system has 64GB of RAM, I could only allocate a maximum of 63GB to the Ubuntu virtual machine. The reason for this is that my primary operating system (Windows 11) requires a certain amount of RAM to function correctly in the background. Specifically, Windows reserves approximately 1GB of RAM, which prevents the full 64GB from being allocated to the virtual machine. While it's theoretically possible to swap some SSD storage to act as RAM, this is generally not recommended due to the significant performance degradation it would cause. I have had no issues or error messages regarding the CPUs.
