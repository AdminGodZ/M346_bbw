#### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
A Virtual Private Cloud is a private, isolated section of a cloud provider's network where you can launch your resources, like servers, in a controlled environment. It’s like having your own private data center within the cloud, with added security, access controls, and a customizable network setup.

#### Subnet (Subnetworks):
A Subnet is a segmented part of a VPC that divides the network into smaller, manageable sections. Each subnet can be located in a different geographic zone or can be designated as public (internet-accessible) or private (internal only), helping you organize and control traffic flow within your VPC.

## B) Subnetz und private IP wählen (10%)
