# KN06

I just followed the instructions which were described in the AWS course:

## A) Installation App (20%)
A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend server and returning the server's response to the client.

## B) Vertikale Skalierung  (10%)
Yes, the EBS disk can be enlarged during operation (hot resize), the instance does not have to be stopped for this.
=> I had to click on the Webserver, then select "Storage" and clicking on the Storage. Afterwards select the Storage again and click on the "Actions"-Button and "Modify volume". Type in the new Storage amount and thats it
